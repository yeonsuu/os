Translations of user virtual addresses above are based on a guess at
the binary to use.  If this guess is incorrect, then those
translations will be misleading.

This assertion commonly fails when accessing a file via an inode that
has been closed and freed.  Freeing an inode clears all its sector
indexes to 0xcccccccc, which is not a valid sector number for disks
smaller than about 1.6 TB.
